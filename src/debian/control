Description: Linux RGB LED effect support for the Roccat Vulcan 100/120/121 Keyboard
 This little binary adds some bling to your Roccat Vulcan 100/120/121 Keyboard
 when you use it in Linux. It supports setting up the default "Wave" effect
 that the keyboard can play on its own, as well as a more advanced homegrown
 "Impact" effect that responds to your keystrokes, and does some "ghost"
 typing when you're idle.
